New York City CitiBike Share Bike Project Analysis

CitiBike is a shared bike project initiated on May 27, 2013 at NYC. Named after its sponsor, Citi Bank, CitiBike has more than 8000 bikes and 500 rental stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. It aims to provide NYC residents and visitors with a convenient and thrifty way of transportation. https://www.citibikenyc.com/ 

People can rent CitiBike almost anywhere and return the bike at their destinations. Using the CitiBike is very easy: purchase membership, search for any available bikes nearby, unlock it using membership key, and return the bike in 30-45 minutes effective usage and re-lock it. Since every CitiBike rental station has GPS coordinates, each rental and riding data can be recorded. Citi Bike official website provided user data, including starting and ending time and location for every single trip by any bike, trip duration, bike ID, and user’s gender and date of birth, etc. https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data 

I will use Python to conduct a data analysis on CitiBike’s 2019 Data, to understand how the shared bike system works in NYC, and answer questions such as, who are using CitiBike? When are they riding? Trip duration and distance? Any popular routes? Etc.
